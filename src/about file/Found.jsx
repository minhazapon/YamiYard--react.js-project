            <p className=" text-xl mt-5">Our journey began in 2007, when we decided to<br></br> leave it all behind and travel the world.<br></br> Okay...Hawaii, to be precise. When<br></br> we came back to reality, we wanted to bring <br></br>some of the island with us. Our experience in<br></br> restaurants and bars came in handy, but nothing<br></br> could prepare us for the great joy and<br></br> satisfaction that Olé Poké has brought to us.</p>
